### JQuery Notes
* make sure to include jquery in html
* $(function({...})); is the same as jQuery(function(){...});
* jquery start working when dom are loaded and ready for manipulations (at this point, images might not be ready)

### Animations
* fadeOut() would fade out and set display to none
* fadeIn() would set display back to original one and change the opacity
* fadeTo() would only change the opacity but not touch the display
* fadeToggle() would fade in if it's out, and fade out if it's in
* hide() would set display to none
* show() would remove display: none
* toggle() would show if it's hide, and hide if it's show
